**<h1>Course Support</h1>**

you may want to get in touch with the AWS community, or reach out to the team who created this course. 

This video is to help you understand where to direct your questions. 

You may have questions about the AWS services you are learning about, or you might find that you have a specific question about something you are working on related to AWS. 

For these types of questions, I highly recommend you check out Repost. 

Repost can be found at the URL, repost.aws. And this website gives you access to a vibrant community where you can ask AWS-related questions and get answers. 

Something to keep in mind about our courses is that AWS innovates at an extremely fast rate. 

This means that some of our content can get slightly out of date when new features are released, or if the AWS console changes. 

If you see any out of date, incorrect, or broken content, you can contact us course creators directly by reporting the issue using the form that is included in the course materials following this video. 

An example of something you would use this form for is a hands-on tutorial or exercise that has instructions that are out-of-date or are no longer correct. 

If you have something go wrong within your AWS console while working through an exercise or lab, this is not something that you would enter a ticket for, as we will not have access to your specific AWS account. 

The ticket system is meant as a place to report issues with our courses. 

Finally, if you have a question about a course completion certificate or anything related to the learning platform you're taking this course on, please reach out to the learning platform to support and resolve these issues. 

I hope this helps you find the help you need. See you later.
